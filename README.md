Maximization of Wireless Sensor Networks Lifetime via Linear Programming [with Python and GUROBI]

This code simulates the lifetime maximization problem for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using a linear programming approach. 

Python is used to construct the network and energy models, while GUROBI API is used to build the linear programming model and for the solution.
